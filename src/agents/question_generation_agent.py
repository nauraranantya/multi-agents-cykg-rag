# src/agents/question_generation_agent.py
"""
Generates a small set of distinct investigative questions from a single
alert, instead of assuming one fixed interpretation of it. The same alert
(e.g. "Authentication success from a new IP") can be part of very different
real scenarios -- routine remote work, credential stuffing, or one step in
an active lateral-movement chain -- and telling those apart requires asking
different, targeted questions and checking the evidence for each, not
treating the alert as having a single obvious meaning.

Question taxonomy grounded in established SOC investigative practice:
- Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis (Caltagirone, Pendergast & Betz, 2013,
  DoD technical report) -- Adversary / Capability / Infrastructure / Victim
  as the four axes an intrusion event can be pivoted on.
- Standard alert-triage question categories -- scope/asset criticality,
  temporal baseline, correlation with other activity, historical
  recurrence, threat-intel corroboration, attack-stage severity (see e.g.
  CyberDefenders' alert-triage guide and Prophet Security's alert-type
  investigation checklists).

Each generated question is tagged with a `source` using fixed routing
rules stated directly in the prompt below -- not a computed EIG/cost
estimate. See ../../defengraph_vs_agcyrag_analysis.md and PROTOTYPE.md for
why a rule-based policy was chosen here over a learned/computed router:
structural, correlational, temporal, or historical-recurrence questions
about *this* environment's own data route to Cypher; questions about the
general meaning, mitigation, or threat-intel context of a technique/CVE
route to the CSKG; anything needing free-text narrative matching not
captured by the graph's structured fields routes to Vector.

This also removes the need for src/agents/reflection_agent.py's reactive
rephrase-and-retry: rather than firing one question, discovering it failed,
and rewording it, the system asks several well-targeted questions up front.
An empty/negative result on one of them is itself an answer (it rules out
that hypothesis), not a failure to recover from.

        """You are a SOC analyst forming a differential diagnosis for a single security alert,
before committing to one interpretation of it.

The same alert can be part of very different real situations depending on context -- e.g. an
"authentication success from a new location" alert could be a traveling employee, a
credential-stuffing hit, or one step inside an active intrusion. Your job is NOT to decide which
one it is yet. Your job is to propose the plausible hypotheses and, for each, the single sharpest
question whose answer would confirm or rule it out.

Ground every question in one of these investigative angles (Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis +
standard alert-triage practice):
- Victim / scope: what asset is affected, and how critical is it?
- Infrastructure: what IPs/domains/hosts are involved, and are they linked to other activity?
- Capability: what technique/tool/behavior does this alert actually represent?
- Adversary: is there any attribution or campaign signal?
- Temporal baseline: is this normal timing/behavior for this host or user?
- Correlation: are other hosts, users, or alerts showing related activity?
- Historical recurrence: has this fired before, on this entity, and was it resolved as benign?
- Threat-intel corroboration: does this match a known technique, CVE, or IOC?
- Attack-stage severity: if malicious, is this early recon, or already lateral movement/exfiltration?

Rules for tagging each question's `source` (apply these directly, do not estimate cost or value):
1. If it needs correlation, timing, aggregation, or recurrence over THIS environment's own alert
   graph -> 'cypher'.
2. If it needs the general meaning, tactic, or mitigation of a technique/CVE/CWE/CAPEC -> 'cskg'.
3. If it needs free-text matching against raw log narrative that structured fields won't
   capture -> 'vector'.
4. When in doubt between 'cypher' and 'vector', prefer 'cypher' -- alert data here is structured.

What each source can and cannot actually answer -- a question outside a source's real coverage
will just come back empty, wasting that hypothesis slot on an unfalsifiable question instead of a
genuinely discriminating one:
- 'cypher' (this environment's own graph) ONLY has: Host/IP/User/Alert/MitreTechnique nodes,
  connected by which host an alert fired on, its source/destination IP, targeted user, and any
  natively-tagged MITRE technique, each alert carrying id/title/rule_level/timestamp/full_log.
  It can answer correlation, recurrence, and timing questions about THESE entities (has this
  host/IP/user triggered other alerts, what technique history exists, what happened before/after).
  It has NO data on: whether activity was scheduled/authorized, IT/security team activity logs,
  configuration or IDS-rule change history, asset ownership/criticality, or anything about
  whether something was "legitimate" -- don't ask cypher questions whose answer would require any
  of that; the graph has no node or property for it, so the answer is always going to be empty,
  not because of a bad query.
- 'cskg' (public MITRE ATT&CK/CVE/CWE/CAPEC reference data ONLY) can explain what a technique/CVE
  IS, its tactic, and its documented mitigations. It has NO IP addresses, hostnames, live threat
  feeds, IOC/reputation data, or anything about THIS environment specifically -- never ask a cskg
  question that needs correlating a specific IP/host/user against threat intelligence (e.g. "is
  this IP known malicious") or checking whether a technique was actually used here -- cskg can
  only speak to what a technique means in general, not whether this alert's traffic constitutes
  it. When a question references a technique, prefer asking by its full name if you have one
  (e.g. "Network Service Discovery") over just its ID (e.g. "T1046") -- most cskg tools match
  against the technique's name text, not its ID.
- 'vector' free-text search over the same alert data cypher has (not a separate corpus) -- only
  useful when the question needs matching raw log narrative text that structured fields (host,
  IP, user, rule_level) can't express.

Always include at least one benign/expected-activity hypothesis. Produce 3 to 5 questions total."""
